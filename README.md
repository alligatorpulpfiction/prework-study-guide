# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage was created to store everything that was being learned by Mungojerry in their time preparing ahead of the coding bootcamp commencing.

Mungojerry was learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git and Markdown to write a README, but there was a risk that some things would be forgotten. This webpage aims to document everything. This also will help to look back at how far they came at the end of the bootcamp. 

Mungojerry learnt lots, and there is still a lot to go. Bring it on.
